## Course Description

This course will take you through the essentials of feature engineering. We'll start with an introduction to machine learning and feature engineering, laying the groundwork for understanding the importance of feature engineering in the context of data analysis and model building.

The core part of the course covers popular feature extraction techniques, including principal component analysis, normalization, autoencoders, and more. Each technique will be explained briefly, followed by a live coding session where we will delve deeper into two selected techniques.

After the theoretical overview, we'll engage in a hands-on live coding session where we'll apply two feature extraction techniques to analyze a fertility clinic dataset. This practical exercise will reinforce your understanding of the concepts covered in the course.

Throughout the course, we'll host Q&A sessions after each milestone, providing you with the opportunity to clarify doubts, ask questions, and engage with fellow participants.

By the end of this course, you'll have a solid foundation in feature engineering techniques and their practical applications in machine learning.
